# Forex

Currency conversion fees are usually considered to be unavoidable. But due to the amount of money exchanged globally between different currencies, traders could easily exchange the money directly between themselves, thus avoiding the conversion fees imposed by the banks. This website is where people would post what currencies they have and which ones they desire. Once a match is found they trade directly with the posted contact information.
